/*
Write an island counter for a 2D matrix. This function should return the number
of distinct islands present.

An island is a group of connected 1s (*vertically* or *horizontally* connected).
0 represents water. Islands are distinct if they are separate connected groups.

Examples

islandCounter([
  [1,1,0,0,0],
  [1,1,0,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1,1],
  [0,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,0,0,1]
]) ➞ 4

islandCounter([
  [0,0,0],
  [0,0,0],
  [0,0,0]
]) ➞ 0

function islandCounter(/* args */) {
